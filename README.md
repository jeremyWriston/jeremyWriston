Well, hey there! I'm Jeremy and I began coding pretty regularly in the beginning of 2021.
I began with Web Development, but was quickly convinced into pursuing more of an IT support/cyber security role.
I got my CompTIA A+, and started applying to jobs while learning Python in the meantime.
Learning Python helped me realize that IT probably wasn't the best fit for me...
Sure, I could do the work, but it didn't really engage me like coding.
Luckily, my current job is comfortable enough that I didn't HAVE to take an entry level position in IT, so I'm back to enjoying web development!

So far in my coding journey I have learned the basics of Web Development, a la HTML/CSS/JS, as well as Python.
I have used some Bootstrap, but I really want a better understanding of the core languages before I fully jump into libraries.
I'm currently working on a few web apps for my portfolio:
 
  - I Ching Oracle Game App
  - Photography Landing Page / Portfolio
  - Minimum Elevation Change Direction App
  - Real Estate Agent Page
  
Right now I am learning how to use API's and manipulate the DOM and I plan on learning Node and React once I reach a comfortable point with a few portfolio projects.

Collaborating is honestly a little outside of my scope right now, and I'm trying to get a better foundation before jumping into that.
That being said I would love to eventually work on apps focused on Minecraft to impress my daughter!
I also went to school for GIS and am very interested in working with mapping API's.
